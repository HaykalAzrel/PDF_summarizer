Tujuan: The primary objective of this research is to develop an accurate prediction model for Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) in Switched-Mode Power Supplies (SMPS) using Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and Neural Network (NN) methods. The goal is to identify and mitigate EMI impacts, which can degrade electronic device performance.\n",

            "2. Isi Utama: This study proposes a combined MLR and NN model to predict EMI. MLR is used to understand the linear relationship between system parameters and EMI, while NN captures more complex non-linear relationships. Data comes from Lorenz and Ramp signals, each with distinct characteristics representing EMI patterns. The results indicate that the combined MLR-NN approach outperforms conventional methods in prediction accuracy. Unique characteristics of Lorenz and Ramp signals are shown to have varying impacts on model performance.\n",

            "   - EMI is a disturbance affecting electronic system performance due to electromagnetic sources.\n",
            "   - SMPS is a type of power supply that generates EMI, impacting electronic system performance and potentially damaging devices.\n",
            "   - MLR is used to understand linear relationships between system parameters and EMI, while NN captures complex non-linear relationships.\n",

            "4. Kesimpulan: The research contributes to the development of machine learning techniques for EMI prediction and mitigation in electronic devices, particularly in power supply systems like SMPS. The combined MLR-NN model demonstrates better prediction accuracy than conventional methods, and the unique characteristics of Lorenz and Ramp signals impact model performance differently.\n",
